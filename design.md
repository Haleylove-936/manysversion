## Elder-First Design Principles

1. **Minimum touch target: 72×72pt** for all primary actions
2. **Font size: 20sp minimum** for all body text
3. **High contrast**: foreground on background meets WCAG AA
4. **Single action per screen**: never more than 2 choices at once
5. **No icons without labels**: every icon has a text label
6. **Confirmation before delete**: always ask before discarding
7. **Warm, familiar aesthetic**: like a family photo album, not a tech app
